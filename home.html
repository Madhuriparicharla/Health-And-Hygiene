    <p>
        <span class="side-heading">CONCEPT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE:</span><br>
        The World Health Organization (WHO-1946) defines health as a "state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." Thus, it is a basic human right. Providing conducive conditions for achieving normal health is the duty of both the state and society. Health is essential to life, without which nothing can be achieved. The sick and hungry child cannot learn, and the sick and hungry adult cannot produce. In other words, health is a state of equilibrium between physical fitness, mental balance, and social adjustment.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="side-heading">Concept of Hygiene:</span><br>
        The term 'hygiene' derives from "Hygeia," the goddess of health in Greek mythology. Hygiene is "the science of health and encompasses all factors that contribute to healthy living." Another definition states that hygiene is "the science of preventing disease and promoting health." The aim of hygiene is not only to preserve health but also to improve it.

        <span class="side-heading">Healthy Individual Criteria:</span><br>
        An individual may be considered healthy if they are physically fit, mentally sound, and socially well-adjusted. Any imbalance in these components—physical, mental, or social—may result in discomfort or disease. This concept can be illustrated through an equilateral triangle with equal angles of 60 degrees representing physical, mental, and social health. Any variation in angle or imbalance in any of the triangle's arms signifies illness, while a balanced triangle represents a completely healthy individual.

        <span class="side-heading">Physical Health</span><br>
        Crew (1965) observed that the sign of physical health in an individual constitutes
a good complexion, a clean skin, bright eyes, lustrous hair with a body well
clothed with firm flesh neither too thin nor too fat, a sweet breath, a good
appetite, sound sleep, regular activity of bowels and bladder and smooth,
easy coordinated movements. All the organs of the body are unexceptional
in size and function normally. All the special senses are intact. The resting
pulse rate, blood pressure and tolerance etc. are all within the range of
'normality' in the context of the individual's age and sex. In the young and
growing individual, there is a steady gain in weight and in the mature this
weight remains more or less than the individuals weight at 25.
On the basis of above signs the basic health needs include a hygienic and
balance diet, pure water, a good habitat, neighbourhood and community with
basic sanitation, suitable clothes, well regulated life-style, exercise and personal
hygiene. A periodic health check up is also very essential for good health.

    <p>
        <span class="side-heading">Mental Health</span><br>
        The old saying "healthy mind in a healthy body" confms the inter-relationship
        between mental and physical health. Poor mental health affects physical health
        and vice-versa. According to WHO Technical Report (1964), the psychological
        factors are considered to play a major role in disorders such as hypertension, peptic ulcer and asthma. A mentally healthy person is free from internal Concepts of Health and
        has good self-control.
        As such mental health primarily needs physical health. The other important
        needs are a good home, a good neighbourhood, a good community and job
        satisfaction. The psychologists are of the opinion that the dissatisfaction of
        instinctual and basic life needs leads to insanity. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <span class="side-heading">Social Health</span><br>
        The social health of the people in a community is determined and judged on
        the basis of their personal and social characteristics. One who plays one's
        roles, according to one's status and is apt in establishing and maintaining
        harmonious relationship in family and community and on job is considered
        socially a healthy person. On the contrary, when he fails to perform these
        roles, neglects social relations, indulges in bad habits and gets involved in
        homicide, suicide, crime, gambling, drinking etc., he is considered abnormal.
        Therefore, family and social welfare services are important. Social health
        needs to deal with the problems connected with social existence of individuals.
        But these needs are seldom integrated with health services which is a great
        weakness of health care delivery system in most societies. Some of the determinants
        of health are-heredity, environment, life-style, socio-economic conditions,
        health and family welfare services together with other factors such as food,
        agriculture, education, industry, social development, social welfare, etc.
